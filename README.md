# CS300-Portfolio

In the final project of this course, the main goal was to create a menu of courses using a particular data structure with functions to load courses, print all courses, and print a certain course.

I approached this problem by considering all the data structures and runtimes I've learned about so far and chose what I thought was the most optimal data structure, which was binary search trees.

Whenever I encountered a difficult roadblock, a good tactic for me was to just take a 5 minute break and step away from the computer, I was able to gather my thoughts and come back refreshed.

This project has expanded on my approach for designing software and developing programs, I now know about more data structures, the pros and cons of each data structure, and often think more about what data structure is right for the task.

During this project, I'd say the way I write programs has evolved since I feel like the use of my comments have improved, my abstraction of code to a user-friendly menu worked well, and I thought my work with the print all function made adapting it for other tree traversal methods easier.
